Description: 
This script starts the batch simulations of different battery thermal management 
systems (BTMS) in different climates. The results correspond to Figures 6,7 and 8 in the 
research article entitled "Techno-economic Design of Battery Thermal Management Systems"
and figure S5 in the supplement.

## Load inputs
Usecase = loadPowerProfile("BLEL50_Kentridge") #Load power demand profile
Climate_Sgp = loadTemperature("Singapore_2015", Usecase["dt"]) #Load ambient temperature and solar irradiation data for Singapore
Climate_Muc = loadTemperature("Munich_2015", Usecase["dt"]) #Load ambient temperature and solar irradiation data for Munich

## Define Design of Experiment
DOE = Dict()
DOE["Ebat"] = 98e3 #Battery size in Wh
DOE["Pthreshold"] = 300e3 #Peak shaving threshold in W
DOE["Cooling_thresholds"] = 25:60 #Cooling thresholds
DOE["Heating_thresholds"] = 10:20 #Heating threshold in Â°C
DOE["Passive"] = ["base", "fins"] #Thermal designs with passive cooling
DOE["Active"] = ["base", "fins", "ins"] #Thermal designs with active cooling

## Run experiment
@time res_Sgp = experiment(DOE, Usecase, Climate_Sgp) #Run experiment for Singapore
@time res_Muc = experiment(DOE, Usecase, Climate_Muc) #Run experiment for Munich

## Plot results
